# 🧳 Travel Itinerary Form – Vigovia Internship Submission

This repository contains my submission for **Round 2** of the **Vigovia Fullstack Internship Program**. As a passionate frontend developer, I have built a **fully responsive, design-accurate travel itinerary form** based on the provided Figma design.

My approach was focused on clean UI/UX, reusability of components, responsiveness, and feature completeness — especially the **PDF download functionality**, as per the task requirement.
